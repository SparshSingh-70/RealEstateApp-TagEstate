# RealEstateApp-TagEstate
This project involves building a modern, full-stack real estate application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), Redux for state management, JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication, Vite as a fast development tool, Firebase for cloud storage, and Render for deployment.

##Key Features:
User Authentication & Authorization (JWT):

Secure login and registration using JWT for user authentication.
JWT tokens are issued on successful login, which the client (React) stores and uses to authenticate API requests.
Role-based access control to restrict certain features (like adding properties) to authenticated users only.
Frontend (React + Redux):

React is used to build the user interface, ensuring a dynamic and responsive experience.
Redux is implemented to manage global application state, ensuring smooth data flow across components, particularly for user authentication state, property listings, and user profiles.
Users can view property listings, filter search results, and see detailed property information.
Responsive design ensures the app works across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB):

The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js for handling API requests and serving the frontend.
MongoDB serves as the NoSQL database for storing property listings, user information, and other data (such as user reviews or property inquiries).
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations allow for adding, editing, and deleting properties.
Real-Time Data & Firebase:

Firebase is integrated for features like cloud storage (storing images of properties) and authentication (optional for Google/Facebook login).
Firebase Firestore or Realtime Database can be used for storing and retrieving user data, property details, and even user messages or property inquiries in real time.
Fast Development (Vite):

Vite is used as a build tool to significantly speed up the development process. It ensures fast refresh, fast bundling, and easy configuration for the React app.
Vite also provides optimized builds for production, minimizing the loading time for users.
Deployment on Render:

The app is deployed using Render, a cloud platform for deploying web applications and APIs.
Both the backend (Node.js/Express) and frontend (React) are hosted on Render, providing automatic scaling and monitoring.
Admin Panel (Optional):

Users can filter property listings by various criteria (location, price, size, etc.).
A search bar allows users to search for specific properties quickly.
